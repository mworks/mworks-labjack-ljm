    Interface to devices compatible with the `LabJack LJM library
    <https://labjack.com/pages/support?doc=/software-driver/ljm-users-guide/>`_.
    Currently, the LabJack `T4 <https://labjack.com/products/labjack-t4>`_ ,
    `T7 <https://labjack.com/products/labjack-t7>`_, and `T8
    <https://labjack.com/products/t8>`_ are supported.

    For information on acceptable values for the parameters `device_type`_,
    `connection_type`_, and `identifier`_, see the documentation for the
    `LJM_OpenS function
    <https://labjack.com/pages/support/?doc=/software-driver/ljm-users-guide/opens>`_.

        Interval at which MWorks will poll the device for new input data
  - 
    name: analog_waveform_data_interval
    default: 0
    example: 1ms
    description: >
        Interval at which the device will output samples on a
        `LabJack LJM Analog Waveform Channel`.  This is a device-level
        parameter, because all analog waveform channels must use the same
        data interval.
  - 
    name: analog_waveform_trigger_line
    example: FIO6
    description: |
        Name of the digital line that triggers the start of output on a `LabJack
        LJM Analog Waveform Channel`.  The line must support the `Conditional
        Reset
        <https://labjack.com/pages/support/?doc=/datasheets/t-series-datasheet/13213-conditional-reset-t-series-datasheet/>`_
        extended feature.

        When a trigger line is specified,
        `LabJack LJM Start Analog Waveform Output` configures the device and
        uploads all output samples but does *not* start the actual output.
        Instead, output begins when the device detects a rising edge on the
        trigger line.  Subsequent trigger signals will have no effect until
        analog waveform output is
        `stopped <LabJack LJM Stop Analog Waveform Output>` and restarted.

        This is a device-level parameter, because all analog waveform channels
        share a single trigger line.

name: LabJack LJM Analog Waveform Channel
signature: iochannel/labjack_ljm_analog_waveform
isa: LabJack LJM Channel
description: |
    Analog waveform channel on a `LabJack LJM Device`.

    An analog waveform channel outputs a user-defined analog waveform on an
    analog output (i.e. DAC) line.  Samples are output at the rate specified
    by the device-level parameter ``analog_waveform_data_interval``.  All analog
    waveform channels are started and stopped simultaneously, via the
    `LabJack LJM Start Analog Waveform Output` and
    `LabJack LJM Stop Analog Waveform Output` actions, respectively.
parameters: 
  -

    description: Analog output line name
  - 
    name: value
    alias: data
    required: yes
    description: |
        Variable from which to read output voltage values (i.e. samples).  The
        values are output at the rate specified by the
        `device <LabJack LJM Device>`-level parameter
        ``analog_waveform_data_interval``.

        The output values must be provided as either a list of numbers or as a
        string containing the bytes of a double-precision floating-point array
        in native byte order.  The latter format can be created, for example,
        with the `tobytes method
        <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.tobytes.html>`_
        of a `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_ array.

        The output values are read when
        `LabJack LJM Start Analog Waveform Output` executes.  Therefore, they
        can be changed at any time during the experiment, with the latest values
        being read the next time waveform output is started.
  - 
    name: loop
    default: 'NO'
    description: |
        If ``YES``, the samples provided in `value`_ are output repeatedly in a
        loop, producing a periodic waveform.  Otherwise, the samples are output
        only once.

        If the waveform does not loop, then once all the samples have been
        output, the specified `line`_ will remain active with the value given
        by the last sample until analog waveform output is `stopped <LabJack
        LJM Stop Analog Waveform Output>`.  To make the output go to zero as
        soon as the waveform ends, provide a value of zero for the last
        sample.
