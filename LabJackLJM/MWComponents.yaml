parameters: 
  - 
    name: first_line
    required: yes
    example: [FIO4, eio7, DIO16]
    description: |
        Name of the digital line from which to read the first (least significant)
        bit of words stored in `value`_.  Subsequent bits are read from the
        lines following the first, up to the total number of lines specified by
        `num_lines`_.

        For example, if the first line is FIO6, and the number of lines is 4,
        then lines FIO6, FIO7, EIO0, and EIO1 will provide bits 0, 1, 2, and 3,
        respectively, of the input word, where bit 0 is least significant and
        bit 3 is most significant.
